You are a senior automation engineer.

Write a python Playwright script that does the following:

INPUT:
- A JSON or CSV list of companies with fields:
  - company_name
  - country
  - sector

TASK:
For each company:
1. Open Google Search (https://www.google.com)
2. Search using this query pattern:
   "<company_name> <country> official website contact"
3. Handle Google consent popup if it appears.
4. From the search results page:
   - Identify the most likely official website (exclude LinkedIn, Facebook, Crunchbase, Wikipedia, news sites).
   - Extract visible contact details directly from Google if available:
     - Emails
     - Phone numbers
     - Address
     - Website URL
5. Open the identified official website in a new page.
6. Try to locate a "Contact", "Contact Us", "About", or footer section.
7. Extract:
   - Email addresses (mailto links and visible text)
   - Phone numbers
   - Physical address
   - Social media links (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook)
8. Normalize and deduplicate the extracted data.

OUTPUT:
- Save results into a structured JSON file with this schema:
  {
    company_name,
    country,
    sector,
    website,
    emails: [],
    phones: [],
    address,
    social_links: [],
    source: ["google", "website"]
  }

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Playwright with Chromium
- Use realistic delays and waitForSelector to avoid detection
- Use regex to extract emails and phone numbers
- Gracefully handle missing data and timeouts
- Log failures and continue processing the next company
- Do NOT hardcode selectors that are too brittle

BONUS:
- Add a helper function to score and pick the best website URL
- Block images and ads for faster scraping
- Export a CSV in addition to JSON
